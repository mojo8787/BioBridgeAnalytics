As a Marketing Specialist at Karmalite Medical Esthetic, I managed inventory during a period of high pricing and low market liquidity. Utilizing simple Excel sheets, I strategized to move products effectively. To combat these challenges, I initiated campaigns to promote lower-cost devices, achieving quicker inventory turnover. For higher-priced devices, I engaged in targeted follow-ups with potential buyers who had shown prior interest. I also implemented a trade-in program, offering discounts on new devices to buyers who traded in older equipment.

As the lead author, I spearheaded a study published in BMC Microbiology that investigates the antibacterial efficacy of Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) modified with geraniol. Utilizing a range of characterization techniques including UV/Vis spectrophotometry, X-ray powder diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy, we assessed the nanoparticlesâ€™ activity against both common and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains like Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA. Our findings point to the modified TiO2 NPs as a viable alternative to traditional antibiotics, especially for tackling antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

As the first author, I led an in-depth review focusing on the recent advancements in antimicrobial applications of Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles. The paper offers a comprehensive analysis of contemporary methods to enhance the antimicrobial properties of TiO2, serving as a strategic response to the growing threat of multidrug-resistant pathogens. The study also critiques the role of UV light in these processes and reviews a variety of evaluation techniques used in current research.
