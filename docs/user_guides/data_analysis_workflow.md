   - PCA plot for high-dimensional data exploration
3. Configure the visualization parameters
4. Interpret the visualization and note patterns or anomalies

## 3. Statistical Testing

### Step 3.1: Hypothesis Testing

1. From the "Statistical Analysis" section, select "Hypothesis Testing"
2. Choose the appropriate statistical test:
   - T-test for comparing two groups
   - ANOVA for comparing multiple groups
3. Configure the test parameters:
   - Select the numeric variable to analyze
   - Specify grouping variable and groups to compare
4. Run the test and review the results:
   - Test statistic
   - p-value
   - Effect size (if applicable)
   - Statistical significance interpretation

## 4. Machine Learning Analysis

### Step 4.1: Data Clustering

1. Navigate to "Machine Learning" in the sidebar
2. Select "Clustering" as the analysis type
3. Choose columns for clustering
4. Select clustering method (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN)
5. Configure algorithm-specific parameters
6. Run the clustering analysis
7. Examine cluster statistics and visualizations
8. Optionally add cluster labels to your dataset for further analysis

### Step 4.2: Predictive Modeling

1. From the "Machine Learning" section, select "Simple Prediction"
2. Select target variable to predict
3. Choose predictor variables
4. Select model type (Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
5. Configure model parameters
6. Train the model and evaluate performance:
   - RÂ² score
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
7. Examine feature importance (for applicable models)
8. Review predicted vs. actual values plot

## 5. Genomic and Protein Analysis

### Step 5.1: Database Searching

1. Navigate to "Genomic API" in the sidebar
2. Configure API settings if needed
3. Select a database to search (NCBI, UniProt)
4. Enter search terms and parameters
5. Review search results
6. Select specific records for detailed analysis

### Step 5.2: Sequence Analysis

1. From the "Genomic API" section, access sequence analysis
2. Enter a sequence or use one retrieved from database search
3. Select analysis type
4. View sequence properties and statistics
5. Save or export results as needed

## 6. AI-Powered Analysis

### Step 6.1: Research Paper Analysis

1. Navigate to "AI Analysis" in the sidebar
2. Upload or paste research paper text
3. Choose analysis type:
   - Paper summarization
   - Entity extraction
   - Key finding identification
4. Configure analysis parameters if applicable
5. Run the analysis and review AI-generated insights

### Step 6.2: Protein Sequence Analysis with AI

1. From the "AI Analysis" section, select sequence analysis
2. Enter a protein sequence or use one from previous steps
3. Select protein language model and analysis type
4. Run the analysis to get AI predictions about:
   - Protein function
   - Structural properties
   - Binding sites
   - Evolutionary significance

## 7. Export and Documentation

### Step 7.1: Export Results

1. Navigate to "Export Results" in the sidebar
2. Choose export format:
   - HTML Report: Complete analysis documentation
   - CSV Files: Individual data and results files
   - Excel Workbook: Multiple sheets with all analyses
3. Configure export options
4. Generate the export files
5. Download the files to your local system

### Step 7.2: Export Visualizations

For individual visualizations:
1. Hover over any visualization
2. Use the Plotly toolbar to:
   - Save as PNG/SVG
   - Zoom in/out
   - Pan
   - Download as PNG
3. Incorporate these visuals into your research documents

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Clean Data**: Ensure your data is properly formatted and missing values are handled
2. **Explore Before Modeling**: Always perform exploratory analysis before machine learning
3. **Validate Results**: Cross-reference findings across different analyses
4. **Document Your Process**: Take notes on methods and parameters used
5. **Save Intermediate Results**: Export important findings throughout your analysis
6. **Verify Biological Relevance**: Use domain knowledge to interpret results

## Troubleshooting

- **Data Loading Issues**: Check file format compatibility and encoding
- **Visualization Errors**: Ensure selected columns have appropriate data types
- **API Connection Problems**: Verify internet connectivity and API credentials
- **Performance Issues**: For large datasets, consider sampling or splitting analyses

By following this workflow, you can effectively analyze biological data using the BioData Explorer platform, from initial data exploration to AI-powered insights and publication-ready exports.
