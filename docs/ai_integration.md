    """
```

## API Configuration

### OpenAI API
- Requires an OpenAI API key
- Configured in the application settings
- Supports various models (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, etc.)

### Hugging Face Models
- The application uses pre-trained protein language models
- Supports various ESM (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) models
- Local inference or API-based prediction available

## Usage Examples

### Summarizing a Research Paper

```python
from components.ai_integration import summarize_research_paper

# Research paper text
paper_text = """
[Research paper content here]
"""

# Get a summary focused on methodology
summary = summarize_research_paper(
    text=paper_text,
    focus_area="methodology and results"
)

print(summary)
```

### Extracting Biological Entities from Text

```python
from components.ai_integration import extract_biological_entities

# Scientific text
scientific_text = """
The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.
Mutations in these genes can increase the risk of these cancers.
"""

# Extract entities
entities = extract_biological_entities(scientific_text)

# Display extracted entities
for category, items in entities.items():
    print(f"{category}:")
    for item in items:
        print(f"  - {item}")
```

### Analyzing a Protein Sequence

```python
from components.ai_integration import analyze_sequence_with_ai

# Protein sequence
protein_sequence = "MVLSPADKTNVKAAWGKVGAHAGEYGAEALERMFLSFPTTKTYFPHFDLSHGSAQVKGHGKKVADALTNAVAHVDDMPNALSALSDLHAHKLRVDPVNFKLLSHCLLVTLAAHLPAEFTPAVHASLDKFLASVSTVLTSKYR"

# Analyze the sequence
analysis_results = analyze_sequence_with_ai(
    sequence=protein_sequence,
    analysis_type="function_prediction"
)

# Display results
print(f"Predicted Function: {analysis_results['predicted_function']}")
print(f"Confidence Score: {analysis_results['confidence_score']}")
for property_name, value in analysis_results['properties'].items():
    print(f"{property_name}: {value}")
```

## AI Models Used

### OpenAI Models
- GPT-3.5-turbo: Used for general text analysis and summarization
- GPT-4: Used for more complex analysis when available

### Protein Language Models
- ESM-2 (facebook/esm2_t33_650M_UR50D): 650M parameter model trained on 65 million protein sequences
- Other models can be specified by the user

## Error Handling

The AI Integration component includes robust error handling for:
- API authentication issues
- Rate limiting and quotas
- Invalid input data
- Model-specific errors
- Network connectivity issues

Errors are captured, logged, and returned as user-friendly messages to guide troubleshooting.

## Privacy and Data Security

- No user data is stored by default
- API calls are made directly from the user's session
- User-provided API keys are handled securely

## Dependencies

- openai: For OpenAI API integration
- transformers: For Hugging Face model integration
- torch: Required for local model inference
- requests: For API calls

## Performance Considerations

- Text processing uses token-aware chunking for large documents
- Model inference is optimized for response time vs. accuracy
- Caching is used to avoid redundant API calls

## Extension Points

The AI Integration module can be extended by:
1. Adding support for additional language models
2. Implementing new analysis types
3. Creating specialized prompts for specific biological domains
4. Integrating with other AI services (e.g., AlphaFold, ESMFold)
